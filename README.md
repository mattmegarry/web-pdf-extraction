# web-pdf-extraction

A series of experiments in building UIs that allow users to extract and save text from PDF files, whilst reading them in the browser.

## PDF.js

Most experiments, unless otherwise stated, use PDF.js - this is the framework used (and built) by Mozilla Firefox to display PDFs in the browser. PDF.js renders PDFs into actual DOM nodes, so this seems like a promsising place to start.
